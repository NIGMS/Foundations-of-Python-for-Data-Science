    "---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this project, you'll build a Python class to represent liver tissue samples collected for biomedical research. You'll practice object-oriented programming by validating real-world data, converting units, and analyzing sample quality. This task models how clean, reusable code supports meaningful scientific discovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning/practice objectives\n",
    "In this project, you will strengthen your abilities to:\n",
    "- Use object-oriented programming to model and manage biological data.\n",
    "- Apply data validation techniques to ensure scientific accuracy.\n",
    "- Write methods that perform calculations and support data analysis.\n",
    "- Build scripts that load, filter, and summarize real-world datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- Submodule 1\n",
    "- Submodule 2 (especially Pandas so you can import the dataset\n",
    "- Submodule 3 Tutorials\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, you will find a task prompt that will require you to define a new Class which can handle a dataset. You can attempt the task on your own, or use the guided prompts which are each followed by a \"fill-in-the-blank\" model. You can copy each of those sections, edit them, and use each to build a class then write a script. If you get stuck, the entire solution is in the next tutorial.\n",

    "## Project: Building a LiverSample Class for Biomedical Data Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "You've been hired as a data analyst for a biomedical research lab working on metabolic regulation in liver tissue. The lab collects and freezes liver samples from patients to study glycogen metabolism, enzyme activity, and glucose homeostasis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the data comes in raw spreadsheets and contains errors, like incorrect pH values or missing identifiers. Your job is to streamline this data handling by designing a LiverSample class to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Import and validate liver sample data.\n",
    "- Filter out samples with invalid pH.\n",
    "- Convert blood glucose levels from mg/dL to mM.\n",
    "- Store the collection date and enable future time-based analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What You Know**\n",
    "Each row in the dataset represents one liver sample and includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sample ID (Format L###)\n",
    "- Mass (mg)\n",
    "- Freezer Location\n",
    "- LDH (U/L) *that is, Units/L*\n",
    "- Blood Glucose (mg/dL)\n",
    "- Glycogen (mg/g)\n",
    "- ALT (U/L) \n",
    "- pH\n",
    "- Time Since Collection (min) *a measure of quality*\n",
    "- Collection Date (YYYY-MM-DD)\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ“Œ Your Task\n",
    "\n",
    "You will create a class called **LiverSample** that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Takes one row of data as input during initialization.\n",
    "- Validates the data:\n",
    "   - Ensures pH is between 5.5 and 8.5. If not, skip or flag the sample.\n",
    "   - Validates that mass is positive, and collection date is in proper YYYY-MM-DD format.\n",
    "- Contains a method called convert_glucose_to_mM() to convert blood glucose:\n",
    "     Formula: mM = (mg/dL) Ã· 18.0182\n",
    "- Stores validated samples in a list of objects so you can filter, analyze, and summarize them later.\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… What to create:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Your LiverSample class with methods and validation.\n",
    "2. A script that loads all 30 rows, filters out invalid entries, and prints:\n",
    "- Number of valid samples\n",
    "- Average glucose (converted to mM)\n",
    "- List of sample IDs that were removed due to bad pH\n",
    "\n",
    "The data file is accessed as: \"./Datasets/liver_samples.csv\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, you will find a guided set of tasks and, if you want, a \"fill-in-the-blank\" solution to each below (but with the code hidden unless you open it). \n",
    "\n",
    "A full solution is in the [final tutorial](Submodule_3_Tutorial_4_ProjectSolution.ipynb)\n",
