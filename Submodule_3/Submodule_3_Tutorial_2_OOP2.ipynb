    "## Attributes\n",
    "Attributes act as a window into a class‚Äôs internal data. They allow objects to store and manage information, such as a patient's diagnosis, genetic data, or calculated age. In some programming languages, attributes are called properties, serving as a way to interact with the data inside a class.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Typically, when we declare variables inside the __init__ constructor, we are creating instance attributes‚Äîthese belong to each individual object and are referenced using an underscore (_) to indicate they should not be accessed directly. However, not all attributes need to be set manually; some, like age, can be calculated dynamically based on stored information.\n",

    "In the following example, we will create some attributes manually (using __init__) and others with a \"decorator\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of storing a patient‚Äôs age as a fixed value (which would become outdated), we store their date of birth (_dob) and use a calculated property to determine their age whenever it is needed. This ensures that age is always accurate without requiring manual updates. \n",
