# Tutorial 6: Digital Object Identifiers for your Github Data
------------------------------------------------------------------
## Overview
There are a few tools and platforms that offer DOI creation for files, datasets, or software associated with GitHub. However, **Zenodo** is the most widely known and trusted service for assigning DOIs to GitHub-hosted content. Thus, this tutorial will focus on using this tool.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this tutorial, you will be able to:
- Understand the purpose of a DOI in scholarly communication and FAIR data compliance.
- Identify Zenodo as a trusted research data repository for archiving GitHub-hosted data and software
- Create and connect a Zenodo account to GitHub to enable DOI generation.
- Prepare a GitHub repository for archiving, including adding a README, license, and release.
- Create a formal GitHub release that can be archived and assigned a DOI.
- Locate and cite the DOI generated by Zenodo for their release.

## Prerequisites
Please complete tutorials 4 and 5 in advance.

## Introduction
A DOI (Digital Object Identifier) provides a persistent, globally unique, and **citable reference** to a specific version of your dataset or software. Under the FAIR data principles‚ÄîFindable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable‚ÄîDOIs play a critical role in ensuring that:

üîé Findable: Data can be reliably located through metadata indexing services like DataCite or CrossRef.

üîó Accessible: A DOI ensures there‚Äôs a stable link to a publicly available version (or metadata record).

üìö Reusable: Citation via DOI promotes proper attribution, credit, and encourages ethical data reuse.

üß¨ Versioned and Documented: DOIs can be assigned to specific releases of data/software, creating an auditable research trail.

In short, DOIs support transparency, reproducibility, and proper data citation, making them a key element of FAIR-aligned research.

[Zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org/) is a free, reputable platform maintained by CERN and OpenAIRE. It integrates with GitHub to automatically archive releases and assign a DOI.

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Prepare Your GitHub Repository
Make sure your repository has:
- A clear README.md (describing the project or data).
- A LICENSE file (open licenses like MIT, CC-BY, etc. are recommended). See [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository)
- A versioned release (Zenodo will archive specific releases, not your live repo). See [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository)

2. Create a Zenodo Account
- Go to https://zenodo.org
- Click Sign In (you can use your GitHub, ORCID, or other credentials).

Once signed in, go to your Dashboard.

3. Connect Your GitHub Account to Zenodo
- Go to Zenodo GitHub Settings
- Click Connect GitHub.
- Authorize Zenodo to access your GitHub account.

You‚Äôll see a list of your repositories‚Äîflip the toggle to enable archiving for the repo you want to assign a DOI.

4. Create a GitHub Release
**DOIs are generated only for releases, not for every commit.**

- In your GitHub repository, click the "Releases" tab.
- Click ‚ÄúDraft a new release‚Äù.
- Tag it with a version number (e.g., v1.0.0).
- Add a title and description (e.g., ‚ÄúInitial release of dataset‚Äù).
- Click Publish release.

Zenodo will automatically archive this release and assign a unique DOI.

5. Find Your DOI on Zenodo
- Go back to Zenodo.org
- Click Dashboard ‚Üí Uploads or GitHub
- Click on your project

You‚Äôll see a permanent DOI like this:

**10.5281/zenodo.1234567**

This DOI is now persistent, citable, and indexed.
