    "\n",
    "Microsoft Azure is a platform that lets you use remote computers (\"the cloud\") to run programs and store data without needing the physical hardware. Azure can provice a virtual environment where you can run Jupyter Notebooks, Python or R programs, or other tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure \"Machine Learning\" (ml.azure.com) is a service within Azure that makes it easy to set up and manage Jupyter notebooks in the cloud. Itâ€™s useful if you need to run data analysis or machine learning experiments on more powerful machines than your local computer. You can choose different numbers of virtual \"cores\" (the numbers of parallel computers processing your program) depending on your needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The remote computers are secure and cost a nominal amount to use. \n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li> If you have an NIH Cloud Account, the costs are covered when you use your Cloud credentials and subscription. (See tutorial 3b to learn how) and skip to Step 4</li>\n",
    "    <li> Otherwise, you will have to provide payment information for your work </li>\n",
    "    <li> After that, you will need to create a workspace to be able to run the NIGMS tutorials now and, hopefully, your own data analysis in the future. At first, this seems overly complex since you only need one place to work. Remember that this is a tool for programmers and for companies who may have lots of projects running.</li>\n",
