    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, students will analyze a dataset containing information about various factors related to diabetes. They will use Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data wrangling and visualization, and apply statistical inference techniques to explore relationships between variables and diabetes. The goal is to identify potential causes of diabetes through single and multiple regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "A [solved version](./Submodule_2_Tutorial_7_ProjectSolutions.ipynb) of this exercise is also provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "In this project, you will practice the skills obtained in this module to understand the basis for diabetes. These skills include:\n",
    "1. Working with Pandas Dataframes with NumPy skills\n",
    "2. Visualizing the datsets\n",
    "3. Performing regression and statistical analysis to assess the relationships between biological characteristics and diabetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "You should have completed all the tutorials in Module 2 and developed some level of comfort with the tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "The 5 tasks are described below. Solutions for each part are provided in a [solved version](./Submodule_2_Tutorial6_ProjectSolutions.ipynb) of this notebook"

    "Many clinical measurements have been associated with the risk of developing diabetes. We will use your newly developed skills to assess this dataset to evaluate the efficacy of each parameter as a predictor of diabetes. The final column (\"Diabetes\") is already dummy coded with diabetes =1. Thus, simple linear regression analysis will provide a kind of measure of the fraction of disease risk associated with that factor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, more than one factor may be interacting and relating. \n",
    "\n",
    "In your bioinformatics or biological/clinical work, you might expect to do similar kinds of analysis. You should find that, compared to running these analyses in Excel or some (commercial) statistical package, you will be able to rapidly and reproducibly analyze, numerically and visually, any size dataset. In the cloud, you could analyze the kinds of datasets which could be created from the Million Veteran project or UK Biobank. \n"
